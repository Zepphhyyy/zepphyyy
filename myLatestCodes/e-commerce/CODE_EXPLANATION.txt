This is like a DELIVERY PERSON BETWEEN YOUR WEBSITE AND YOUR STORAGE ROOM.

When the website needs something, it sends a message like:

SIMPLE EXAMPLE:
If someone asks for products:
→ api.php says "Okay! Let me get them from storage!"
→ It gives back all the products

When action = save_order:
1. Gets the order information from checkout
2. Gets customer info (name, email, phone, address)
3. Gets the cart items
4. Sends everything to the database
5. Returns success message with order ID

WHAT'S IN IT:

Database Host: localhost
(This means it's on your own computer, not a remote server)

Database User: root
(The username to access the database)

Database Password: (empty)
(No password needed in this case)

Database Name: pandora_produce
(The actual database to connect to)

WHAT IT DOES:
1. Creates a connection to MySQL
2. Creates database if it doesn't exist
3. Selects that database

KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER
================================================================================

1. PHP FILES = THE BRAIN
   - index.php: Main page with products
   - header.php: Top navigation (on every page)
   - footer.php: Bottom section (on every page)
   - cart.php: Shopping cart display
   - checkout.php: Payment form
   - admin.php: Order management
   - setup.php: First-time setup
   - api.php: Messenger between frontend and database
   - db-config.php: Database connection
   - db-functions.php: Database operations
   - init-database.php: Database builder

2. JAVASCRIPT FILES = THE HANDS (What makes things interactive)
   - script.js: Product interactions (view details, add to cart)
   - cart.js: Cart management (modify, calculate totals)
   - checkout.js: Checkout process (submit order)
   - admin.js: Admin dashboard (view orders)

3. CSS FILE = THE PAINTER (Makes it look good)
   - style.css: All colors, fonts, layouts, animations

4. DATABASE FILES = THE MEMORY (Stores information)
   - database.sql: Blueprint for tables
   - MySQL database storage: Actual data storage
   - 4 tables: products, users, orders, order_items

EVERYTHING WORKS TOGETHER LIKE A TEAM!
- Frontend (user sees): HTML + CSS + JavaScript
- Backend (hidden): PHP + MySQL
- Communication: API (api.php)
