QUIZ APPLICATION - SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
====================================

FIXED ISSUES:
1. ✓ Restart button now works properly - rebuilds the quiz container
2. ✓ Database changed to use LONGBLOB for images instead of TEXT
3. ✓ Images are now base64 encoded when sent to frontend
4. ✓ All codes are properly integrated and working

FILES STRUCTURE:
- index.html          : Main quiz interface (HTML structure)
- quiz.js             : Quiz logic and functionality
- style.css           : Styling and responsive design
- config.php          : Database configuration
- get_questions.php   : Backend API to fetch questions from database
- upload_question.php : Admin page to add questions with images
- database.sql        : Database schema

SETUP STEPS:
===========

1. CREATE DATABASE:
   - Open phpMyAdmin: http://localhost/phpmyadmin
   - Create new database OR import database.sql
   - Run the SQL commands from database.sql to create tables

2. UPDATE DATABASE CREDENTIALS (if needed):
   Edit config.php and update:
   - $servername = "localhost"
   - $username = "root"
   - $password = "" (your MySQL password)
   - $database = "quiz_db"

3. ACCESS THE QUIZ:
   - Open: http://localhost/myLatestCodes/Quiz/
   - You'll see an empty quiz (no questions yet)

4. ADD QUESTIONS WITH IMAGES:
   - Go to: http://localhost/myLatestCodes/Quiz/upload_question.php
   - Fill in the question text
   - Upload an image (JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP)
   - Enter 4 answer options
   - Select which option is correct
   - Click "Add Question"
   - Repeat to add more questions (minimum 1 needed for quiz to work)

5. START THE QUIZ:
   - Go to: http://localhost/myLatestCodes/Quiz/
   - The quiz will load all questions from database
   - Answer each question
   - Click "Next Question" to continue
   - View your final score at the end
   - Click "Restart Quiz" button to try again

HOW IT WORKS:
=============

Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript):
- Displays large image in center
- Shows 4 answer buttons in 2x2 grid below the image
- Shows score and question progress in header
- When an answer is selected, it shows correct/incorrect feedback
- Clicking restart rebuilds the entire quiz interface

Backend (PHP/MySQL):
- Stores questions with binary image data in database
- Converts images to base64 format for display
- Sends all questions with answers as JSON to frontend
- Shuffles questions and answers for variety

DATABASE SCHEMA:
================

Table: questions
- id (INT, PRIMARY KEY)
- question_text (VARCHAR 255)
- image_data (LONGBLOB) - stores binary image data
- image_type (VARCHAR 50) - stores MIME type (e.g., 'image/jpeg')
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)

Table: answers
- id (INT, PRIMARY KEY)
- question_id (INT, FOREIGN KEY)
- answer_text (VARCHAR 255)
- is_correct (BOOLEAN)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
================

1. "No questions available" error:
   - Make sure you've added at least 1 question via upload_question.php
   - Check database connection in config.php

2. Restart button not working:
   - Clear browser cache
   - Reload the page

3. Images not showing:
   - Make sure image was uploaded successfully
   - Check image file size (should be reasonable)
   - Try uploading a different image format

4. Database connection error:
   - Verify MySQL is running
   - Check credentials in config.php
   - Ensure quiz_db database exists

CUSTOMIZATION:
==============

To modify the quiz appearance:
- Edit style.css for colors, fonts, and layout
- Modify quiz.js to change scoring logic or add features
- Update index.html to add more functionality

NOTE: Do not modify config.php, get_questions.php, or database.sql 
unless you know what you're doing and understand the database structure.
